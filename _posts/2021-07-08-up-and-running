I've finally been able to figure out how to create the Jekyll blog in Github Pages and after some gentle persuasion I've got it looking how I want.  As I don't currently have any Ruby, Jekyll or Git experience I've found that it's taken me a fair amount of headscratching to figure out how to get the site to use the theme; the actual change wasn't that complicated (setting the url field correctly), but my basic level of knowledge made it 10 times harder than it really was.

Now the site is up and running the next step will be to do some tidying to make sure the links work and look to see how I can personalise it a bit more to make it feel like home.

I'll also start thinking about what the first bit of learning an/or Python project will be as I'm really keen to make a start on something which will refresh my Python knowledge as it's been a while since I was learning it before.

Oh well, onwards and upwards..
