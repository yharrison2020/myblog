I've decided to start a private blog to record my progress against my personal learning goals so I can track my goals and to potentially share this site if I reach a high enough level where I'm confident to switch careers.

I'm currently working for the Ministry of Justice as part of a team who are responsible for three national reporting applications and although I'm not hands-on at the moment I have previous experience of SQL, Business Objects, Excel & VBA and before that building websites using HTML, CSS and Cold Fusion.  I've already completed some Udemy courses in Javascript and Python and I'd now like to take my learning further.

<!-- more -->

My main learning goal this year is to refresh my previous Python learning and to increase my knowledge through developing projects and looking for advanced learning opportunities.  I'm also aiming to find ways to introduce industry standard practices and/or my current employer's standards into my work to ensure I can showcase best practice.

I've also chosen to include blogging/journalling using Jekyll as one of my learning objectives to build a responsive blog which will include my projects as well as details of my other learning. 

*Caveat: I'm really not a blogger so please don't expect to find any really interesting reads here - unless I suddenly figure out what I'm doing!*
